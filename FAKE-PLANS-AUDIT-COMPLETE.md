## Why Fake Plans Are Bad

1. **Checkout Will Fail:** Users try to buy plans that don't exist
2. **Wrong Price Display:** Shows prices for non-existent products
3. **Commission Loss:** Affiliate tracking won't work
4. **Bad User Experience:** Users click "Купи Сега" but nothing happens

---

## Verification From Saily API

### What Actually Exists:
- ✅ **Country Plans:** Real - 5 per country (Serbia, Turkey, Thailand, etc.)
- ❌ **Regional Plans:** Mostly DON'T exist (Saily has very few regional plans)
- ❌ **Global Plans:** Few exist (long-duration ones like 365 days)

### Real Example:
When fetching Serbia plans from Saily API, we get:
- ✅ 5 country-specific plans
- ❌ **0 regional plans** (no "Europe", "Balkans", etc.)
- ✅ A few global plans (20GB/365d, 10GB/180d, 5GB/60d)

---

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Removed all fake plans from Thailand
2. ✅ Removed all fake plans from Serbia  
3. ✅ Removed all fake plans from Dubai
4. ❌ Need to remove from Egypt, USA, UK, Turkey (still pending)

---

## Recommendation

**ONLY include:**
- ✅ Country-specific plans (verified real from Saily API)
- ✅ Verified global plans IF they actually exist

**DO NOT include:**
- ❌ Any plan with fake identifier (`saily_*`)
- ❌ Regional plans unless confirmed real
- ❌ Made-up plans

---

## Verification Method

Run this to verify what's real:
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/fetch-and-verify-all-plans.ts
```

This shows ONLY plans that actually exist in Saily API!
