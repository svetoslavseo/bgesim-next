# Blog Featured Images - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented featured images for all blog posts with gradient overlay matching the original WordPress site design.

## What Was Done

### 1. Image Download Script
Created `scripts/download-blog-featured-images.ts` that:
- Extracts featured image URLs from all blog post JSON files
- Downloads images from the original WordPress site
- Saves them locally in `public/media/blog-featured/`
- Creates a mapping file at `data/processed/blog-featured-images.json`

### 2. Featured Image Component
Created `src/components/common/BlogFeaturedImage.tsx` with:
- Responsive image display
- Purple gradient overlay (`rgba(173, 108, 165, 0.81)`) matching original site
- Optimized Next.js Image component
- Proper height adjustments for mobile devices

### 3. Blog Post Page Integration
Updated `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to:
- Import the featured images mapping
- Display featured image at the top of each post
- Include gradient overlay as shown on original site
- Maintain proper SEO metadata

### 4. Blog Listing Page Integration
Updated `src/app/blog/page.tsx` to:
- Show featured images in blog post cards
- Use existing Card component's image support
- Display images consistently across the listing

## Design Features

### Featured Image Hero
- Full-width hero image at top of each blog post
- Height: 400px (desktop), 300px (tablet), 250px (mobile)
- Cover fit with centered positioning
- Purple gradient overlay matching original site

### Blog Listing Cards
- Featured images displayed in card headers
- Consistent sizing across all cards
- Properly linked to blog posts
- Maintains responsive grid layout

## Technical Implementation

### Image Optimization
- Uses Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- Lazy loading for better performance
- Proper width/height attributes from metadata
- Priority loading for featured images (above fold)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adjustable heights for different screen sizes
- Maintains aspect ratio on all devices

### SEO Considerations
- Proper alt text for all images
- Open Graph images remain pointing to original URLs (for social sharing)
- Local images used for display (faster loading)
- Structured data includes image information

## How to Re-run Image Download

If new blog posts are added or images need to be refreshed:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/download-blog-featured-images.ts
```

This will:
1. Scan all post JSON files for featured images
2. Download any missing images
3. Skip existing images
4. Update the mapping file

## Gradient Overlay Details

Matching the original site's style attribute:
```css
background-image: linear-gradient(
  rgba(173, 108, 165, 0.81),
  rgba(173, 108, 165, 0.81)
), url(image.png);
```

Implemented as separate overlay div for better Next.js Image compatibility.

## Testing

To verify the implementation:
1. Visit `/blog` - should see featured images in card grid
2. Click any post - should see hero image with purple overlay
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Verify images load quickly with Next.js optimization

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- [ ] Add hover effects on blog listing images
- [ ] Implement image blur placeholders
- [ ] Add caption support for featured images
- [ ] Support for different overlay colors per category
- [ ] Add srcset for better responsive image delivery

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All blog posts now display their featured images with the characteristic purple gradient overlay from the original WordPress site.
