# Trailing Slash Redirect Implementation

## Overview

All URLs now have trailing slashes, and URLs without trailing slashes are automatically redirected with a 301 (permanent) redirect to the version with a trailing slash.

## Configuration Details

### Next.js Configuration

The `next.config.js` file has `trailingSlash: true` enabled, which ensures all generated URLs have trailing slashes:

```javascript
trailingSlash: true,
```

This means URLs like:
- `/blog/post-name` → `/blog/post-name/` (with trailing slash)
- `/page` → `/page/` (with trailing slash)
- `/` → `/` (homepage already has trailing slash)

### Railway Deployment (Primary)

For Railway deployment, a custom Node.js server (`server.js`) handles the 301 redirects:

**Features:**
- ✅ 301 redirects for URLs without trailing slashes
- ✅ No redirects for static files (CSS, JS, images, fonts, etc.)
- ✅ No redirects for HTML files
- ✅ Security headers included
- ✅ Proper caching headers
- ✅ 404 handling

**Example:**
- Request: `https://yoursite.com/blog/about`
- Response: 301 redirect to `https://yoursite.com/blog/about/`

**Updated Files:**
- `server.js` - Custom Node.js server with trailing slash redirect logic
- `nixpacks.toml` - Updated to use `node server.js` instead of `npm start`

### Other Hosting Platforms

The project includes configuration files for other hosting platforms:

#### Apache (.htaccess)
**File:** `public/.htaccess`

Redirects all non-static URLs without trailing slashes to versions with trailing slashes.

#### Netlify (_redirects)
**File:** `public/_redirects`

Netlify-specific redirect rules for trailing slashes.

#### Vercel (vercel.json)
**File:** `vercel.json`

Vercel configuration with trailing slash redirects via rewrites.

#### Nginx (nginx.conf)
**File:** `nginx.conf`

Complete Nginx configuration with trailing slash redirects.

## How It Works

### 1. During Build

When you run `npm run build`, Next.js generates all pages with trailing slashes:
- `/blog/post-name/` → Directory with `index.html` inside
- `/page/` → Directory with `index.html` inside
- `/` → Root `index.html`

### 2. During Request

When a user visits a URL without a trailing slash:

1. **Railway (Custom Server):**
   - The `server.js` checks if the URL should redirect
   - If it's not a static file and doesn't have a trailing slash, it sends a 301 redirect

2. **Other Platforms:**
   - Platform-specific configuration (`.htaccess`, `_redirects`, `nginx.conf`, etc.) handles the redirect

### 3. SEO Benefits

- ✅ Consistent URLs across the site
- ✅ Avoids duplicate content issues
- ✅ Better link equity (301 redirects preserve SEO value)
- ✅ Improved user experience (no broken URLs)

## Testing

To test the redirects locally:

```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# Start the custom server
node server.js

# Test URLs:
# http://localhost:3000/blog (redirects to http://localhost:3000/blog/)
# http://localhost:3000/turcia (redirects to http://localhost:3000/turcia/)
# http://localhost:3000/favicon.ico (no redirect)
```

## Deployment to Railway

The configuration is already set up for Railway:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Railway will automatically:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build with `npm run build`
   - Start with `node server.js`
   - Handle all trailing slash redirects

**No additional configuration needed!**

## Verification

After deployment, verify the redirects are working:

```bash
# Check redirect status (should return 301)
curl -I https://yoursite.com/blog

# Should see:
# HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location: https://yoursite.com/blog/
```

## Static Files Exclusion

These file types are NOT redirected:
- `.css`, `.js`, `.json`
- `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, `.webp`, `.ico`
- `.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`, `.eot`
- `.xml`, `.txt`
- `.html` files
