## Known Issues

### Pre-existing TypeScript Errors (Not Related to Currency Implementation)
The following TypeScript errors exist in the codebase but are **not caused by the currency implementation**:

```
src/components/country/HeroSection.tsx - 4 errors (pre-existing)
src/components/country/PlansSection.tsx - 4 errors (pre-existing)
```

These are about potential `undefined` values in string operations and were present before currency implementation. They do not affect the currency conversion functionality.

## How to Use

### For Users
1. Visit any country page (e.g., `/turcia`, `/esim-thailand`)
2. Look for BGN/EUR switcher in navigation
3. Click to toggle between currencies
4. Prices update immediately across the page

### For Developers

#### Manual Rate Update
```bash
npm run update-rates
```

#### Setup Weekly Automation (Windows)
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "cmd.exe" -Argument '/c cd /d "C:\Users\Svet\PythonProjects\wp-esim-bg-clone" && npm run update-rates'
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -DaysOfWeek Sunday -At 00:00
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Update eSIM Currency Rates" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger
```

#### Setup Weekly Automation (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs every Sunday at midnight)
0 0 * * 0 cd /path/to/wp-esim-bg-clone && npm run update-rates
```

## Price Conversion Examples

### Original Price: $10 USD

With current rates (2025-10-24):
- **BGN**: $10 × 1.69 = **16.90 лв**
- **EUR**: $10 × 0.861 = **8.61 €**

### Serbia Plans (Converted from BGN to USD)
- 26 лв → **$14.44** (stored in code)
- 20 лв → **$11.11** (stored in code)
- 74 лв → **$41.11** (stored in code)

When displayed:
- $14.44 → **25.95 лв** or **13.22 €** (based on current rates)

## Architecture

```
User selects currency (BGN/EUR)
         ↓
CurrencyContext stores selection
         ↓
PlansSection reads plans with USD prices
         ↓
convertPrice() applies exchange rate
         ↓
Display with currency symbol (лв or €)
```

## Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- ✅ Automatic: Rate update script runs (if scheduled)
- ✅ Verify: Check `public/currency-rates.json` has recent `lastUpdated`

### Monthly Tasks
- Review exchange rates for accuracy
- Check ExchangeRate-API status/limits

### As Needed
- Update fallback rates in `src/lib/currency.ts` if API fails
- Switch API provider if needed (see `CURRENCY-RATES-UPDATE.md`)
